# phinterval

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

phinterval provides a `<phinterval>` (say "potentially-holey-interval") class for working with time intervals that potentially contain gaps such as:

-   An employment or educational history.

-   A meeting schedule for the work day.

-   All of the Monday's in a month.

Sometimes it is useful to consider these holey time-spans as a single observation rather than a collection of observations. phinterval provides tools to work with such holey time-span observations.

The implementation of and conventions used in this package borrow heavily from
the [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) `<interval>` class. The 
`<phinterval>` class is meant to be a super-class of `<interval>` and the two
classes are often interchangeable.

## Installation

You can install the development version of phinterval from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EthanSansom/phinterval")
