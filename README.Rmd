{phinterval} is a package for representing and manipulating time spans that may contain gaps. It implements the `<phinterval>` (think "potentially-holey-interval") vector class, designed as an extension of the [{lubridate}](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) `<Interval>`, to represent continuous, disjoint, empty, and unknown spans of time.

Functionality for manipulating these spans includes:

-   Performing set operations: union, intersection, difference, and complement.
-   Merging overlapping or adjacent intervals into non-overlapping sets of time spans.
-   Testing whether time spans, dates, or times fall within one another or overlap.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {phinterval} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("EthanSansom/phinterval")
```
