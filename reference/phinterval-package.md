# phinterval: Set Operations for Time Intervals

Implements the phinterval vector class for representing time spans that
may contain gaps (disjoint intervals) or be empty. This class
generalizes the 'lubridate' package's interval class to support
vectorized set operations (intersection, union, difference, complement)
that always return a valid time span, even when gaps or empty sets are
created.
